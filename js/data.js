            "Gain a deep understanding of building, maintaining, packaging, and shipping robust Python applications Key FeaturesDiscover the new features of Python, such as dictionary merge, the zoneinfo module, and structural pattern matchingCreate manageable code to run in various environments with different sets of dependenciesImplement effective Python data structures and algorithms to write, test, and optimize codeBook Description This new edition of Expert Python Programming provides you with a thorough understanding of the process of building and maintaining Python apps. Complete with best practices, useful tools, and standards implemented by professional Python developers, this fourth edition has been extensively updated. Throughout this book, you’ll get acquainted with the latest Python improvements, syntax elements, and interesting tools to boost your development efficiency. The initial few chapters will allow experienced programmers coming from different languages to transition to the Python ecosystem. You will explore common software design patterns and various programming methodologies, such as event-driven programming, concurrency, and metaprogramming. You will also go through complex code examples and try to solve meaningful problems by bridging Python with C and C++, writing extensions that benefit from the strengths of multiple languages. Finally, you will understand the complete lifetime of any application after it goes live, including packaging and testing automation. By the end of this book, you will have gained actionable Python programming insights that will help you effectively solve challenging problems. What you will learnExplore modern ways of setting up repeatable and consistent Python development environmentsEffectively package Python code for community and production useLearn modern syntax elements of Python programming, such as f-strings, enums, and lambda functionsDemystify metaprogramming in Python with metaclassesWrite concurrent code in PythonExtend and integrate Python with code written in C and C++Who this book is for The Python programming book is intended for expert programmers who want to learn Python’s advanced-level concepts and latest features. Anyone who has basic Python skills should be able to follow the content of the book, although it might require some additional effort from less experienced programmers. It should also be a good introduction to Python 3.9 for those who are still a bit behind and continue to use other older versions.",

            "When it comes to creating powerful and effective hacking tools, Python is the language of choice for most security analysts. But just how does the magic happen? In Black Hat Python, the latest from Justin Seitz (author of the best-selling Gray Hat Python), you’ll explore the darker side of Python’s capabilities—writing network sniffers, manipulating packets, infecting virtual machines, creating stealthy trojans, and more. You’ll learn how to: –Create a trojan command-and-control using GitHub –Detect sandboxing and automate com\u00admon malware tasks, like keylogging and screenshotting –Escalate Windows privileges with creative process control –Use offensive memory forensics tricks to retrieve password hashes and inject shellcode into a virtual machine –Extend the popular Burp Suite web-hacking tool –Abuse Windows COM automation to perform a man-in-the-browser attack –Exfiltrate data from a network most sneakily Insider techniques and creative challenges throughout show you how to extend the hacks and how to write your own exploits. When it comes to offensive security, your ability to create powerful tools on the fly is indispensable. Learn how in Black Hat Python. Uses Python 2",

            "Learn how to write idiomatic, effective Python code by leveraging its best features. Python's simplicity quickly lets you become productive with it, but this often means you aren't using everything the language has to offer. By taking you through Python's key language features and libraries, this practical book shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable all at the same time—what experts considerPythonic. Many programmers who learn Python basics fall into the trap of reinventing the wheel because of past experience in other languages, and try to bend the language to patterns that don't really apply to it. Author Luciano Ramalho, a Python Software Foundation member and Python programmer for 15 years, helps you drop your accent from another language so you can code Python fluently. Learn practical applications of generators for database processing Rethink some design patterns in a Python context Examine attribute descriptors and when to use them: the key to ORMs Explore Pythonic objects: protocols versus interfaces, abstract base classes and multiple inheritance",

Each topic is preceded by an introduction followed by more advanced topics, along with numerous examples, that take you to an advanced level. There are nine different sections within the book covering Computer Graphics (including GUIs), Games, Testing, File Input and Output, Databases Access, Logging, Concurrency and Parallelism, Reactive programming, and Networking. Each section is self-contained and can either be read on its own or as part of the book as a whole. This book is aimed at the those who have learnt the basics of the Python 3 language but want to delve deeper into Python’s eco system of additional libraries and modules, to explore concurrency and parallelism, to create impressive looking graphical interfaces, to work with databases and files and to provide professional logging facilities.",

            "Python is fast becoming the programming language of choice for hackers, reverse engineers, and software testers because it's easy to write quickly, and it has the low-level support and libraries that make hackers happy. But until now, there has been no real manual on how to use Python for a variety of hacking tasks. You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore. Gray Hat Python explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools—and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it. You'll learn how to: –Automate tedious reversing and security tasks –Design and program your own debugger –Learn how to fuzz Windows drivers and create powerful fuzzers from scratch –Have fun with code and library injection, soft and hard hooking techniques, and other software trickery –Sniff secure traffic out of an encrypted web browser session –Use PyDBG, Immunity Debugger, Sulley, IDAPython, PyEMU, and more The world's best hackers are using Python to do their handiwork.

            "Violent Python shows you how to move from a theoretical understanding of offensive computing concepts to a practical implementation. Instead of relying on another attacker's tools, this book will teach you to forge your own weapons using the Python programming language. This book demonstrates how to write Python scripts to automate large-scale network attacks, extract metadata, and investigate forensic artifacts. It also shows how to write code to intercept and analyze network traffic using Python, craft and spoof wireless frames to attack wireless and Bluetooth devices, and how to data-mine popular social media websites and evade modern anti-virus.
